I am a veteran software developer who has developed multi-tier applications using cutting-edge technologies. I specialize in building microservices-driven containerized applications specific to business needs.

I've gained experience working as a software developer for one of the leading startups which helped me gain insights into all phases of software development from initial design and implementation to deployment and maintenance.

I have 3 years of experience as a developer and love working with Golang and distributed systems. And yeah I know with this experience I am calling myself a veteran but hey don't take my word for it you can give me a chance and decide yourself.
